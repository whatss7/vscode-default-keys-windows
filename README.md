This extension provides the default key bindings for Windows on any platform. Originally [created by smcpeak](https://github.com/smcpeak/vscode-default-keys-windows). Thank you for creating such a useful extension!

The extension specifically provides default key bindings for VSCode 1.98.2 on Windows.

[This issue](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_can-i-run-vs-code-server-on-older-linux-distributions) could makes VSCode 1.99+ unavailable in certain circumstances. While installable extension for that version exists, [Issue #11](https://github.com/smcpeak/vscode-default-keys-windows/issues/11) could cause troubles, which are fixed only in higher versions. That's why I made this downgrade fork.

For more information, see [README in original repo](https://github.com/smcpeak/vscode-default-keys-windows/blob/master/README.md).

To install this extension, download VSIX from Release, and go to VSCode > Extensions > Three dots at right top corner > Install from VSIX.
